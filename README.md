# Dog_Cat_Classification_Deployment

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://dogorcat.herokuapp.com/" rel="nofollow">Dog & Cat Classification App</a></p>

A simple Flask App that can classify an image as Dog or Cat using a convolutional neural network model. I build this just because i wanted to get out of the jupyter notebook and deploy a Deep learning model and have something i can send to friends so they can upload their images of their face and let my app insult them.
